                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I have never been a person that waits for someone else to solve a problem. If I see a problem, I will do what I can to find a solution for it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the past few years, I have started to look through the lens of a software developer, seeing solutions to problems my colleagues and I face every day in the form of software. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I recently decided to take the leap and start a coding bootcamp with The Tech Academy to turn my software ideas into a reality. It is one of the best decisions I have made in my life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created this site as a place to share my projects. I encourage you to reach out to me if you want to collaborate or discuss any of my projects in more detail.

                    <h3>The CCP Connection</h3>
                        <p>
                            This web application aims to solve a real-world problem facing partnering high schools and colleges in central Ohio. The current process for high school students signing up for college classes is composed of many pieces of paper and what seems like an endless stream of emails. The process is confusing, fragmented, and riddled with failure points. The CCP Connection will connect all of the stakeholders via a single online portal that manages the entire course request process, from start to finish. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My work on the project thus far has served two purposes: 1) reinforce the skills learned after each course and 2) act as a proof of concept, demonstrating that the project idea is viable. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            HTML/CSS Only UI (<a href="https://www.theccpconnection.com/" target="_blank">Live Site</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidfryling/The-CCP-Connection" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This proof of concept was an attempt to build all HTML and CSS from scratch, forcing me to understand how these fundamental parts of web development worked together to bring something that only existed in my head and make it a reality. The POC ended with nearly 20 HTML pages with a single, shared, CSS file that provided a common styling to all pages.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            JavaScript/HTML/CSS UI (<a href="https://www.ccpconnection.com/" target="_blank">Live Site</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidfryling/CCP-Connection" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This proof of concept was a blast! Although the final web app will not be a single-page architecture, I wanted to see if I could dynamically load all of the page content onto a single HTML page with a DOM manipulation with JavaScript. This forced me to rethink the flow and design of the website, streamlining the look and feel of the application. I also spent time working with the CSS to make sure that the layout of the webpages was responsive and changed when viewed on mobile devices.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This proof of concept was amazing! I first created an Entity Relationship Diagram, normalizing the database so that each table represented only one object of the final app. I then used T-SQL to build the database, tables, key constraints, and even many stored procedures to join data into new views that would need to be rendered in the final web app. 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    I am currently working on the backend and beta version of the web app with the .NET (Core?) Framework with an MVC design pattern in the C# language. I will likely use a database-first approach with Entity Framework to tie the database to the Models and Controllers. The web app will likely be hosted on Azure when it moves to production.
                                </li>
