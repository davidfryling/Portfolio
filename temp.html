                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I have never been a person that waits for someone else to solve a problem. If I see a problem, I will do what I can to find a solution for it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the past few years, I have started to look through the lens of a software developer, seeing solutions to problems my colleagues and I face every day in the form of software. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I recently decided to take the leap and start a coding bootcamp with The Tech Academy to turn my software ideas into a reality. It is one of the best decisions I have made in my life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created this site as a place to share my projects. I encourage you to reach out to me if you want to collaborate or discuss any of my projects in more detail.

                <h1>Current Project</h1>
                    <h3>The CCP Connection</h3>
                        <p>
                            This web application aims to solve a real-world problem facing partnering high schools and colleges in central Ohio. The current process for high school students signing up for college classes is composed of many pieces of paper and what seems like an endless stream of emails. The process is confusing, fragmented, and riddled with failure points. The CCP Connection will connect all of the stakeholders via a single online portal that manages the entire course request process, from start to finish. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            By the end of this project, I will have completed the following using an Agile approach of Continuous Development and Improvement:
